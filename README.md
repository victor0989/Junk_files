 Time-dependent numerical simulations of the pulsar magnetosphere start with an initial configuration
 
 𝐁 (𝑟,𝜃,𝜙;𝑡 = 0) = 𝐁dipole (𝑟,𝜃,𝜙;𝑡 = 0)
 that corresponds to a magnetostatic dipole in vacuum, and
 𝐄 (𝑟,𝜃,𝜙;𝑡 = 0) = 0
 everywhere. At time Q = 0
 , the programmer introduces electric fields
 𝐄 (𝑟*, 𝜃,𝜙;𝑡) = −𝑟 sin 𝜃 Ω/𝑐 ^ 𝜙×𝐁dipole (𝑟*,𝜃,𝜙;𝑡)
